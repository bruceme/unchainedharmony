# Unchained Harmony

Nano-light, single-place, composite twin-electric aircraft anyone can build and fly inexpensively

# Open source

I'm looking for folks to actively contribute to the project.  In order to do so, I ask you have a passion for aviation and an objective goal, a piece of the design or manufacture you can focus on and solidly contribute on.

# Forms and structure

Built using simple foam molds and S-Glass fiberglass for lightness and simplicity.

Fuselage female molds are made from foam.  They are carved to a template using a pole running the center as a guide for a tool rotating around the pole.  Once the mold is carved, it is glassed and filled and ready to make parts.

The wings and tail are also build from female molds, but those molds are build using hot wire.  The wing needs only one 3m mold, which is repeated four times.  THe mold is designed to be  

Utilizes uniformly stressed monocoque with internal trussing to minize weight

Motor/battery loads are distributed onto the wings.
